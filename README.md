# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Throughout their growth, machine learning and artificial intelligence have been shown to be  beneficial in a variety of fields, particularly with the recent explosion in data. Making quicker  and more accurate decisions in terms of disease forecasts may be possible using this method. 
As a result, machine learning algorithms are being used more and more to forecast various 
diseases. Making a model can also assist in bettering the consistency and accuracy of disease 
reporting by aiding in the visualisation and analysis of diseases. This article has looked into the 
use of several machine learning algorithms to identify cardiac disease. The research presented 
in this article revealed a two-step procedure. The heart disease dataset is first converted into 
the necessary format for machine learning algorithms to run on it. The UCI repository is used 
to gather patient data, including medical records. The presence or absence of heart disease in 
the patients is then determined using the heart disease dataset. Second, this essay presents a lot 
of useful findings. The confusion matrix is used to validate the accuracy rate of machine 
learning methods including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest￾Neighbours, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. According to recent research, 
compared to other algorithms, the Logistic Regression algorithm provides a high accuracy rate 
of 95%. It also exhibits higher f1-score, recall, and precision accuracy than the other four 
algorithms. The difficult element of this research will be to increase the machine learning 
algorithms' accuracy rates to about 97%–100% in the future
